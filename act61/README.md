The booststrap components that I use are nav-bar it enables me to create a navigation that automatically collapse when the size of the screen get smaller. I manage to use my custome css properties to make the look and feel unique and not look a like of most boostrap components.

I also used nav-tabs which i used along with the card components, it allows me to navigate contents within a tabs and for visual presentation i used cards to organize the contents within the nav-tabs

I also used font awsome icons for the the visuals that represents some of the unique functions of instagram

Last but not the least I also used textarea which formated by a class form-control to maintain the padding and aesthetic of the inputs
